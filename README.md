# Viterbi-algorithm-
The Viterbi algorithm is a dynamic programming algorithm for obtaining
the most likely sequence of hidden states.
•The principle of this algorithm is based on the minimization of distance
between the estimated and received sequences.
•In a communication channel convolutionally encoded bit streams are de-
coded through this algorithm using trellis diagram
•Here the focus is mainly on decoding the data. Data recovering in case of
error is not a part of Viterbi algorithm
